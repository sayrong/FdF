The simple representation in 3D of a landscape with library: miniLibX.

This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french, hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to your program. See /maps.

### How to use

First make programm
```
make

```
